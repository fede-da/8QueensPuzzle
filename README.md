# 8QueensPuzzle
This program solves the 8 Queen Puzzle with a simple UI (SFML).

You will insert the first queen, it will do the rest. Currently queen position must be specified from chessboard.cpp at lines 128 and 129.

I'll add a Cmake, until now Xcode did the job for me.

If you want to use your own makefile remember to use : -std=c++14 (make_unique requires it) and MAYBE -stdlib=libc++
