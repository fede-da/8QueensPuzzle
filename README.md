# 8QueensPuzzle
Compile with : g++ -std=gnu++17 *.cpp -o puzzle

I'll create a makefile and add some improvements.
Until now you can choose where setting the first queen from :
- Chessboard.cpp line 122 and 123 ( rowToSet and colToSet) remember that you can choose numbers from 1 to 8 (included) this means that for any number lower or equal to 0 and greater or equal to 9 it's UB.

If you want to join the project hmu on mail.
Next steps :
- MAKEFILE
- Improve code, clean garbage and make order.
- Add UI components for easy interactions.
